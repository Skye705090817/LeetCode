Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one 
share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Example 1:
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
Example 2:
Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.


class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int max = 0;
        if(!prices.size())
            return 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.size() - 1; ++i) {
            int max1 = 0;
            for(int j = i + 1; j < prices.size(); ++j) {
                max1 = max1 > (prices[j] - prices[i]) ? max1 : (prices[j] - prices[i]);
            }
            if(max < max1)
                max = max1;
        }
        return max;
    }
};



best answer:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int min_num = INT_MAX, max_pro = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            min_num = min(min_num, prices[i]);
            max_pro = max(max_pro, prices[i] - min_num);
        }
        return max_pro;
    }
};
